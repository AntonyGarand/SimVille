# Simville 
C# project of a small city simulation game.  
Comments and controls are in french but should be easily understandable.  
Features include multiple type of buildings, dynamically generated river, save/load possibility and multiple "statistics" based on the different buildings around.  
  
  
Here as showcase of my previous work, I would suggest everyone not to reuse this code though feel free to do so.
